📊 Credit Scoring Model
Internship Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Credit Scoring Model that predicts whether an individual is creditworthy based on financial data such as income, debts, and payment history.

The project demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

🎯 Objectives

Predict an individual's creditworthiness using past financial data.

Compare multiple classification algorithms.

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Identify the most important financial factors influencing credit scoring.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (machine learning models & evaluation)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes the following key features:

Income

Debts

Payment History

Debt-to-Income Ratio (engineered feature)

Creditworthy (Target variable: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

Data was stored in Excel (.xlsx) format and preprocessed before training.

🚀 Approach

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values.

Scaled numerical features.

Engineered new feature: Debt-to-Income Ratio.

Model Building

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation

Classification Report (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

ROC-AUC Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC Curves

Feature Importance (for tree models)

📊 Results

Decision Tree and Random Forest achieved perfect scores on the dataset.

Logistic Regression also performed strongly.

Feature importance analysis revealed income, debt, and payment history as key factors.
